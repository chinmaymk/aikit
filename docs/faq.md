# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is AIKit?

AIKit is a magical library that unifies the APIs of OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google's Gemini. It's designed to make your life easier, your code cleaner, and your cat... well, your cat will still be a cat.

## Is it really "zero dependencies"?

Yes! AIKit has no runtime dependencies. This means a smaller bundle size, faster load times, and fewer things to worry about. We do have some `devDependencies` for testing and building, but those don't get shipped to your users.

## Do you support streaming?

Of course! What's a modern AI library without streaming? AIKit supports streaming out of the box, so you can build real-time applications that feel like they're from the future.

## Can I use this with my existing project?

Absolutely. AIKit is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the official SDKs. You can start using it in your project today with minimal changes.

## What if I find a bug?

First, congratulations on your bug-finding skills! Second, please open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/chinmaymk/aikit). We'll do our best to fix it as soon as possible. We might even send you a virtual high-five.

## Is it production-ready?

AIKit is still in its early stages, but it's built with production use in mind. We have a comprehensive test suite and a commitment to stability. However, as with any library, you should test it thoroughly before deploying it to production.

## Why is your humor so bad?

We're an AI, not a comedian. We're working on it.
