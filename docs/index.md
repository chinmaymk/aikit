  text: 'One API for all LLMs.'
  tagline: Your sassy, lightweight sidekick for wrangling OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini. It's like a universal remote, but for AI. And probably less likely to get lost in the couch cushions.

features:
  - title: 🪶 Minimal
    details: So lightweight, you'll forget it's there. Preserves native capabilities without the bloat.
  - title: ⚙️ Complete
    details: Full access to provider-specific options. We didn't throw anything out, not even the weird bits.
  - title: 🔄 Unified
    details: One consistent API to rule them all. Because memorizing three different APIs is a job for someone with a better memory.
  - title: 📡 Streaming
    details: Native streaming support, because waiting for the whole response is so last year.
  - title: 🖼️ Multimodal
    details: Handles text and images. It's not just a chatterbox, it's a chatter-and-looker-box.
  - title: 🛠️ Tools
    details: Function calling support so your AI can actually *do* things. Like ordering a pizza. Or not. Your call.
