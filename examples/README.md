# AIKit Examples

This directory contains comprehensive examples demonstrating how to use the AIKit library. The examples are organized progressively, from basic usage to advanced features.

## Setup

Before running any examples, you need to set up API keys for the providers you want to use:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key"
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-api-key"
```

You only need to set the API keys for the providers you plan to use.
