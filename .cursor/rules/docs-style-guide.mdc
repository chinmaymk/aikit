# Documentation Style Guide

This guide outlines how to write and structure the documentation for AIKit. The documentation is built with VitePress.

## Guiding Principles

- **Tone**: Keep the language clear, concise, and user-friendly. A bit of humor is encouraged to make the documentation engaging.
- **Structure**: The documentation is divided into three main sections: Guide, API, and Examples.

## Key Files & Structure

- **Homepage**: The main landing page is [`docs/index.md`](mdc:docs/index.md). It uses a `home` layout and should contain a compelling hero section and a list of key features.
- **Configuration**: All navigation and sidebar configuration is located in [`docs/.vitepress/config.mjs`](mdc:docs/.vitepress/config.mjs).
    - When adding navigation links (`nav` or `sidebar`) that point to a directory, ensure the link explicitly points to the `README.md` file within that directory (e.g., `/examples/README`).
- **Guide**: The main user guide is [`docs/guide/getting-started.md`](mdc:docs/guide/getting-started.md). This should provide a clear path for new users to get started with the library.
- **API Reference**:
    - The API documentation is generated by TypeDoc and lives in `docs/api/generated/`.
    - The main landing page for the API section is [`docs/api/generated/README.md`](mdc:docs/api/generated/README.md). This page should provide a welcoming overview and link out to the specific classes, functions, and types.
    - When linking to API pages from the `README.md`, use absolute paths from the docs root (e.g., `/api/generated/classes/AnthropicProvider.md`).
- **Examples**: The examples section is anchored by [`docs/examples/README.md`](mdc:docs/examples/README.md). This file should explain how to run the code examples and link to the actual example files in the `/examples` directory in the project root.
